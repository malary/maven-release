Perform a Release

  Performing a release runs the following release phases:

   * Checkout from an SCM URL with optional tag

   * Run the predefined Maven goals to release the project (by default, <<<deploy site-deploy>>>)

   []

  To perform a release, execute this command:

-------
mvn release:perform
-------

  This relies on <<<release.properties>>> being present from a previous release preparation. If this is not the case,
  you need to give the goal the URL and an optional tag to perform the release from. For example:

-------
mvn release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/tags/maven-release-plugin-2.0
-------

  <<<release:perform>>> will fork a new Maven instance to build the checked-out project. This new Maven instance will use the
  same system configuration and Maven profiles used by the one running the <<<release:perform>>> goal.

  It is possible to
  force some profiles to get enabled during release (for example to enable time-consuming tasks that are only relevant
  at release-time) by setting a comma separated list of profiles names in the <<<releaseProfiles>>> parameter. The goals and
  profiles required to release the project can then be configured in the POM:

-------
  <plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <configuration>
      <!--
        During release:perform, enable the "release" profile
       -->
      <releaseProfiles>release</releaseProfiles>
      <goals>deploy assembly:assembly</goals>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
-------

  After the release is complete, the <<<release.properties>>> and other release files will be removed from the checkout.
